About Me
========

You might want to know a bit more about me before you read about what I do.

I am a fellow that is highly involved in the open source field

Most of what I do on the technical aspect has to do with system administrations, but I also do community management and a small amount of programming

At the age of 14, I was introduced to the amazing world of open source, when I started to attend events of Open Labs Hackerspace.
The local hackerspace has kickstarted my involvement in the IT sector, teaching me many things, both technical and nontechnical

One of the communities I'm most involved at is Mozilla, where I am part of the Tech Speakers program
Mozilla Tech Speakers is a program to bring together volunteer contributors who are already speaking to technical audiences (developers/web designers/computer science and engineering students) about Firefox, Mozilla and the Open Web in communities around the world. We want to support you and amplify your work!

As Mozilla Tech Speakers, participants have an opportunity to work on public speaking skill development with a cohort of technical contributors from many countries. Mozillians old and new, and our allies across the open web, at all levels of experience in public speaking and at different stages in their careers, are welcome to apply. Most participants are not native English speakers, but at this time you must be willing and able to communicate in English to participate in this program.

I am part of Collective68, which is a team of open source professionals who do consulting and much more

I also do various projects, which may on may not have to do with IoT, Music, DIY and so on.

Whenever I am not creating something, I am researching on projects that I can do, which are (of course) open source and nature-friendly
