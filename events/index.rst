Events
======

I have always loved attending events that relate to **open source**. They are what got me started on my journey, and to my belief, are a great way to introduce an idea or a project to many people in an efficient way.

Over the 4 years I've been involved in the open source field, I've been part of both small and big events, mainly the ones organized by the Open Labs Hackerspace in Tirana, where I am a member

In this page you will find an extensive yet incomplete list of events I've been involved at over the course of the last 4 years. They are separated into 3 categories
 1) Events I've spoken at

Events I've spoken at
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Mozilla Weekend 2015
--------------------

Mozilla Weekend 2015 is where everything started for me. I attended it not knowing much about neither the community nor the open source world.


I gave a speech there about the importance of staying vigilant while browsing the internet, and the risks one takes when they fall for a scam.
