Events
======

I have always loved attending events that relate to **open source**. They are what got me started on my journey, and to my belief, are a great way to introduce an idea or a project to many people in an efficient way.

Over the 4 years I've been involved in the open source field, I've been part of both small and big events, mainly the ones organized by the Open Labs Hackerspace in Tirana, where I am a member

In this page you will find an extensive yet incomplete list of events I've been involved at over the course of the last 4 years. They are separated into 3 categories
 1) Events I've spoken at

Mozilla Weekend 2015 is where everything started for me. I attended it not knowing much about neither the community nor the open source world.

It also aims into bringing interested people into the community and showing them what Mozilla is about, in order to grow the local community even more It will be held in a well located university in Tirana, for 2 days, 6 hours a day.

 The negative stigma of remixing, copying and modifying can still be noticed in today’s society where the internet is a key part of our life which is nothing alike with the 20th century. Instead, back then creating and exploring was a privilege which many people did not have. With the diversity of cultures, creations and characteristics, a revolution in the field of author’s rights and work modifications is needed. All these are topics which we want to address in the first edition of Copy Fest, a weekend which celebrates public domain, Copyleft & Creative Commons licenses, and copying, remixing and creative freedom on internet. Movie screening, debates and a round table with actors of creative industry with talks about Creative Commons licenses.
