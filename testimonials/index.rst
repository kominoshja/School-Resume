I always feel like you can't take what someone else says about themselves at face value

So I decided to reach out to some of the people I have had the honor of working with and asked them if they could send me some testimonials or letters of recommendation.

Below you'll find what they responded with

Letters of Recommendation

To Whom It May Concern ,

I am writing today to offer a letter of recommendation for Boris Budini, based upon the
interactions I have had overseeing his work as a technical evangelist. Boris is truly an exemplary
individual; he is a person brimming with knowledge, dedication, and talent; he has a great future
ahead of him. Therefore, It is my honest belief that any university would greatly benefit from
inviting an individual such Boris into their curriculum.

In my work at Mozilla, I serve as a Program Manager responsible for leading Tech Speakers
program. Our program hand-selects technical experts who have the skills required to speak at
industry conferences and provides these individuals with the required training and resources
needed to execute their presentations and workshops. Boris’ commendable and exhaustive early
work in the Mozilla volunteer community earned him his invitation to join the Tech Speakers
program at Mozilla in 2017. Since this time, Boris has remained both one of our most
knowledgeable presenters and one of our top-performers in the program.

Boris is a motivated team player who can blend seamlessly into the team fabric and keep others
inspired. This ability allowed him to be able to execute complex projects effortlessly. His outgoing
and friendly nature makes him an excellent asset to any community. As a mentor among his
peers, Boris is known for his affability as well as friendly and cheerful disposition.

As his manager, I have had ample time to work with Boris directly and to survey his personality
from close range. His earnest willingness to walk the extra mile to accomplish an objective makes
him special among his peers. Through his persuasive public speaking, he has presented the
case for Mozilla effectively at numerous international tech summits, including FOSDEM, which is
one of the biggest open source conferences in Europe. We have been truly honored and
fortunate to have Boris contributing to our program over the past few years.

Therefore, it is my most-honest recommendation that is extended to any institution considering
accepting Boris Budini into their fold. I am confident he would prove to be a valuable asset to
your community, as he has been to ours. I wish him all the best for his future endeavors.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly if you would like to discuss more of my
interactions with Boris.

Warmest Regards,

Michael Ellis

Hello,

I am honored to write to you in support of Boris Budini and his application to the
Canadian Institute of Technology for Computer Science. I have previously worked with
Boris in international open source software projects and as a system administrator at the
Open Labs Hackerspace in Tirana, Albania.

Boris is an excellent candidate to attend your university. In 2015, Boris joined the
Open Labs Hackerspace community at 14 years old. The Open Labs Hackerspace is the
first technology-focused hackerspace in Tirana established to promote and engage the
local community in international free/open source software projects. From an early
point, Boris was curious and resourceful. His curiosity led him to explore the available
technology and infrastructure used at the hackerspace to support members in their
activities and organizing. In 2017, I briefly worked with Boris while he was a part of the
Infrastructure Team at the Open Labs Hackerspace. His accomplishments include
managing the Open Labs public website, deploying and configuring software to enable
collaboration among hackerspace members, set up networking and routing for the
physical hackerspace, and more.

Additionally, Boris is a considerate individual and demonstrates strong
intercultural communication skills. At Open Labs, there is a large community of people.
Being successful requires more than only installing and configuring software; the
interpersonal skills are equally important to engage successfully with peers and work
together to accomplish goals. Boris clearly demonstrated strong interpersonal skills
through his tenure on the Infrastructure Team, both through his interactions with the
governing board and the wider member body of the hackerspace. Furthermore, at 14 he
was accepted as a speaker to the Open Source Conference Albania where he began his
track as an international speaker across Europe to share his knowledge and experiences
with others.

You could not ask for a better student in today’s challenging academic
environment. Thank you for the opportunity to correspond with you on Boris’s behalf.

Warm regards,

Justin W. Flory

OpenStreetMap Belgium  & Open Knowledge Belgium board member;

`I first met Boris during OSCAL'17 in Tirana, Albania. I have been immediately impressed by this young man that was already interested and involved in open-source. Later that year I joined Open Labs Hackerspace and we worked together on the GeoPortal (https://geoportal.openlabs.cc/). I was really impressed to discover that such a young guy had already so much knowledge about sysadmin and it was a real pleasure to work with him.`
