Works

Over the course of years, I have managed to be part of various communities. The amount of maintenance I have dedicated to them would count to a part-time job in each of the following items

Collective68
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Something that I'm really proud of is that I'm part of the Collective68 team. Why am I proud of this?

Collective68 is a team of open source professionals that do a lot of (what I deem to be important) work in the open source world.

We do a lot of consulting, but we also have our products that are Cloud68 and CityZen.

Cloud68 offers solopreneurs and SMEs their own open source infrastructure, where they have full control of their data.

CityZen is the privacy aware city navigation application which is available for Android on F-Droid.

Being part of Collective68 allows me to afford my own living expenses, while doing something I love

Open Labs Hackerspace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I became the sysadmin of Open Labs Hackerspace sometime between late 2016 - early 2017

Throughout the years, I have set up the following platforms, which have helped the local hackerspace in great always

MediaWiki
---------
This is the platform that is used by the hackerspace to document everything, starting from the list of members, to the list of activities and so on

Discourse
---------
Discourse is the software that empowers Open Labs more than any other platform. This is because Discourse is a forum and a mailing list at the same time. This allows asynchronous communication in a similar fashion to emails (but way more accessible to the average user)


Nextcloud
---------
Nextcloud is the Google Drive alternative. It allows the sharing of documents, photos, folders and so on. While this was initially implemented by Giannis Konstantinidis, it was then maintained by me.

Etherpad
--------
Just like Nextcloud is the alternative to Google Drive, Etherpad is the alternative to Google Docs. It allows real time text editing between collaborators. While this was initially implemented by Giannis Konstantinidis, it was then maintained by me

GeoPortal
---------
GeoPortal is a project of Open Labs Hackerspace where the geospatial data provided by the municipality of Tirana can be used to create better online maps of Tirana. While this was initially implemented by Jonathan BeliÃ«n, it was then maintained by me
